This is a simple script/s that will organize your files
in a calendar and date layout; good for the office to organize your shit. still working on it.... as of 03/29/2023.

UPDATE! 06/16/2023
Finished the file-organizer.sh script, its simple enough that anyone with little knowledge in scripting can modify
to their liking. So for this script/s to work; first run/execute the layout.sh script,
then place the file-organizer.sh and INFO file in the SINGLE directory where all your files are stored [don't store files in a directory within the directory that your organizing],
so they can be organized. YES place all the files in a SINGLE directory/folder; they will be organized to the Month and Day
based on the layout INFO file.


UPDATE! 04/04/2023
Made a little change in the layout.sh script. It will create an INFO file of the directory
where you executed/run the layout.sh script. Now, need to work on the file-organizer.sh script.
And yes Im taking my time; Not like the bouncer2.4_5GHz|THEone.


UPDATE! 03/30/2023
Run/execute the layout.sh script in the root-directory/folder it will create the folders of the Months
and within the Months will create the subfolders for the Days. That way you can easily find the files based
on the Month and Day; My advice would be to create a folder of the YEAR then run/execute the layout.sh script
in that directory/folder. Then just right click and sort by Created, so the folders of the Months would
be in order.
