This is a simple script/s that will organize your files
in a calendar and date layout; good for the office to organize your shit. still working on it.... as of 03/29/2023.

UPDATE! 03/30/2023
Run/execute the layout.sh script in the root-directory/folder it will create the folders of the Months
and within the Months will create the subfolders for the Days. That way you can easily find the files based
on the Month and Day; My advice would be to create a folder of the YEAR then run/execute the layout.sh script
in that directory/folder. Then just right click and sort by Created, so the folders of the Months would
be in order.
